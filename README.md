Presentations on technical topics presented by the team

## 1. Non-Fungible Token
In this presentation we cover the concept of fungible and non-fungible tokens(NFTs), the implementation of NFTs, as well as examples of popular NFTs- particularly in the category of collectibles. We deep-dive, presenting various Ethereum standards that are evolving to meet the needs of NFTs and the blockchain. The focus of the presentation then specifically moves to the ticketing industry, where we present the current problems facing the industry, where blockchain is suggested as a solution. We examine a series of Blockchain-based ticketing platforms, standards employed and notable features. We conclude the presentation by summarising what we perceive to be value-adding features and concepts to note.
