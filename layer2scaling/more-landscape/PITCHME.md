## Layer 2 scaling current initiatives (update)

#### #1 TumbleBit

- TumbleBit protocol was invented at the Boston University
- Unidirectional, unlinkable payment hub for Bitcoin
- Combines off-chain cryptographics with on-chain Bitcoin scripting to realize smart contracts not dependent on Segwit

![TumbleBitOverview](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/L2ScalingUpdate/layer2scaling/more-landscape/sources/TumbleBitOverview.PNG)



+++

#### #1 TumbleBit (cont'd)

- Bitcoin scripting used: Hashing conditions, signing conditions, conditional execution, 2-of-2 multi signatures and timelocking
- Fast, anonymous, off-chain payments through an **untrusted** intermediary called the Tumbler
- Classic mixing/tumbling/washing mode or as a fully fledged payment hub
- Two interleaved fair-exchange protocols - *RSA-Puzzle-Solver Protocol* and *Puzzle-Promise Protocol* , relies on the RSA cryptosystem's blinding properties
- Anonymizing through Tor to ensure that the Tumbler server can operate as a hidden service

+++

#### #1 TumbleBit (cont'd)

- Boston University provided a proof-of-concept and reference implementation
- NTumbleBit - C# production implementation of the TumbleBit protocol by Stratis with their Breeze implementation (Nearly production ready)

<u>Strengths</u>

- Anonymity properties
- DoS & Sybil protection
- Balance 
- 2x modes of operation: classic tumbler, payment hub
- Scale ability

+++

#### #1 TumbleBit (cont'd)

- Batch processing 
- Masternode compatibility

<u>Weaknesses</u>

- Payees have better privacy than the payers
- Tumbler service not distributed
- Equal denominations required
